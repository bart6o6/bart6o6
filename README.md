Hi, my name is Bartek.
I'm from Poland and currently living near Wroclaw city.

Since basically always I've been interested in computers - fixing them and testing new software. Programming was also some part of it as a hobby or school lessons.
I've completed a bachelor's and master's degree at AGH University in Cracow at a metallurgical facaulty with a thesis on casting flow and cristalization study.

Currently I'm looking for my first job in web development.
It is challenging to create my projects after a full-time work as an engineer, but I'm trying my best and don't plan stopping.
Check the below presented list of my git-hub repositories, skills I'm developing and forms of reaching me with any questions or feedback which will be very appreciated.

I. Other coding / IT projects i worked on:
	
I.a  An AutoHotkey script to read *.spl files stored by the printer

Description: The script can be placed in any directory. It converts spl->pdf and then reads the content of the pdf and saves it to a txt file. 
Combined with a cyclic robocopy .bat script the process was very simplified in our company. Now all the data from an old 					analisys program can be compared inside an Excel Power Query file.

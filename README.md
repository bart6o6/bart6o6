Hi, my name is Bartek.
I'm from Poland and currently living near Wroclaw city.

Since basically always I've been interested in computers and programming was some part of it as a hobby or school lessons.
I've completed a bachelor's and master's degree at AGH University in Cracow at a metallurgical facaulty with a thesis study on casting flow and cristalization study.

Currently I'm looking for my first job in front/back-end web development.
It is challenging to create my projects after a full-time work as an engineer, but I'm trying my best and don't plan stopping.
Check the below presented list of my git-hub repositories, skills I'm developing and forms of reaching me with any questions or feedback which will be very appreciated.
